# Reinforcement Learning â€“ Four Rooms Assignment

This project implements three reinforcement learning scenarios using a gridworld environment based on the classic Four Rooms domain.

## Setup  
1. run `make venv`
2. run `. venv/bin/activate`
3. run `make install`

You should now be in the python virtual environment with all required packages installed
Note: to get out of the env, type "deactivate" 

## Usage
run `python <script> [-stochastic]`
where `<script>` = [Scenario1.py, Scenario2.py, Scenario3.py]
and `[-stochastic]` is optional

GENERAL
--------
Each model is set to display the optimal trained path at the end of execution. A visualisation of this can be 
seen as an image - "image.png"

Each model has been tuned such that it reaches the packages as described in the assignmetn brief.
